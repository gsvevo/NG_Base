This project will focus on visualizing the shared experiences of refugees through stories. Rather than just use data to educate the audience about the refugee, the goal is to help the audience understand the challenges and experiences that a refugee might go through. We will use interviews, maps, social media data and other reports to share these experiences. The intended audience for this webtool will be internet users, social media consumers, and national geographic subscribers.

Possible data sources:

National Geographic 
UNHCR 
instagram
Twitter
IOM 
News Media
